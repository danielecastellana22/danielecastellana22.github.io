I am a Research Fellow (RTD-A) at University of Florence, Department of Statistics and Computer Science. My interests are mainly related to Machine Learning, with emphasis on tensor decompositions in structured domains. I deepen these subjects during the PhD at the University of Pisa, which I succefully concluded in 2021. At the University of Pisa, I was a member of [CIML](https://ciml.di.unipi.it/) group and [Pervasive AI](http://pai.di.unipi.it/) lab.

During the MSc, I had the opportunity to spend one year at the University College of London (UCL) as an Erasmus+ student. There, I attended Machine Learning MSc courses.

I also like to participate in Competitive Programming contests. In 2011, I won a silver medal at the OII, an italian competitive programming contest for high school students.
