**Research interests:** My research focuses on Machine Learning, with emphasis on structured data, tensor teory, and Bayesian approaches. *Have a look to my [PhD thesis](/assets/pdf/phd_thesis_FINAL.pdf)!*  

**Research group:** Currently, I am member of [Florence Data Science](https://datascience.unifi.it/).
At the University of Pisa, I was member of [CIML](https://ciml.di.unipi.it/) group and [Pervasive AI](http://pai.di.unipi.it/) lab.

**Other:** I like participating in competitive programming contests and playing soccer.
