**Research interests:** My research focuses on leveraging tensor theroy to develop new ML models, with emphasis on ML for structured data. *Have a look to my [PhD thesis](/assets/pdf/phd_thesis_FINAL.pdf)!*  

**Research group:** At the University of Pisa, I was a member of [CIML](https://ciml.di.unipi.it/) group and [Pervasive AI](http://pai.di.unipi.it/) lab.

**Other:** I like participating in competitive programming contests and playing soccer.
