### Research

If you are interested in a PhD in Machine Learning, send me an email to discuss a potential PhD project. 

### MSc Thesis

- **Deep Learning for Soccer Data Analysis** <br>
  We would like to apply DL techniques for images to extract players’/teams’ stats directly from soccer match videos.

- **Machine Learning for Anomaly-based Intrusion Detection** <br>
  We would like to use ML for anomaly-based intrusion detection. In particular, we are interested in investigating approaches such as unsupervised learning (i.e. generative models) and continual learning.
  
- **Latent Space Organization of Variational Auto-Encoders** <br>
  VAE are generative models which can map input data into a latent space which can be sampled to generate new data. In this thesis, we would like to force an organisation of the latent space based on the semantics of the input. Such an organisation should be inferred automatically from examples of usage of the input (e.g. if the inputs are digits, the plus operator can be used to infer the order of the digit).

- **Tensor-based Recursive Neural Networks for Static Code Analysis** <br>
  We would like to use tensor-based RecNN to infer properties of code snippets from their syntactic trees.
