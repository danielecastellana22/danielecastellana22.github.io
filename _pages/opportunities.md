### Research

If you are interested in a PhD on Machine Learning, send me an email to discuss a potential PhD project. 

### MSc Thesis

- **Deep Learning for Soccer Data Analysis** <br>
  We would like to to apply DL techniques for images to extract players/teams stats directly from soccer match videos.

- **Machine Learning for Anomaly-based Intrusion Detection** <br>
  We would like to investigate which ML paradigms is more suitable for anomaly-based intrusion detection, e.g. unsupervised learning (i.e. generative models) and continual learning.
